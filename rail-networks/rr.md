# RichardRail

RichardRail is a railway network and operating subsidiary of RichardCorp for the
RichardCorp Occupied Controlled Territories (ROCT). It was first established in
March 2024, and was bankrupted twice. The aftermath of the second bankruptcy led to
the Collapse and later Restructuring of RichardCorp.

RichardRail was spun off the Southern Highlands Railway with the ROCT-Southern Highlands
Economic Partnership Treaty (RiSEPT), and was originally built fast and cheaply, leading
to massive losses due to safety concerns and lawsuits. This led to the first bankruptcy of
RichardRail, further exarcebated by the lack of Ayase Airport development and the cancellation of
the Airport Express. The result is the sale of ROCT's Northeastern claims to Volans.
