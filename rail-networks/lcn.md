## Statement from Lacon Inc.

```warning
This is a warning from Lacon Inc. regarding the content discussed in this document.
This is not a factual statement, and it is highly likely to be biased.
```

Lacon Inc. does not recognize Shinonome's authority over the undeveloped plains that it
"plans to develop into an airport." Not only is the claim dubious, it is not clearly stated
anywhere, and our railway far predates the claim.<br><br>
Any attempt to realign the railway without our approval **will** be reverted, and we are not
afraid to cause destruction during the reconstruction. If we have to build the viaduct over
a runway, we will. If we have to block the ATC Tower's view, we will. If we have to go through
the airport terminal buildings to build a pillar, we will.<br><br>
Further, the airport's runway design does not interfere with our lines, and we view it as
a blatant ploy to rid the area of the "ugly wooden bridges." As the lawyers say, you
*came to the nuisance*, we were here first.
The Industry Line (then Minami Line)'s extension to Shin-Akiyama far predates Fulahm Railway's
presence in the area, and we view this as an act of corporate aggression.

```note
Author's note: This is only half-serious.
I don't actually hate beepbeep_lettuce39, this is all concept play and made-up anger.
However, the message that I "do not recognize Shinonome's authority" is real.
