# Lacon Railway

Lacon Railway is an extensive network of overworld railways that spans most regions of the server.
The network is comprised of Lacon Railway itself and two subsidiaries, Shin-Lacon and Sancheon Rapid.

## Subsidiaries

### Shin-Lacon

This was originally planned as a supplemental network to Lacon's existing network, mainly to connect
the northern parts of Floating Moonlight city and the trading hall. However, it was soon decided to
cede over the Shin-Higashi Line to Shin-Lacon, giving it a much more extensive network.
<br>To this day, the Shin-Higashi Line, now known as the [Dongbu Line](/rail-lines/slcn-dongbu-line)
is the longest line on the network.

### Dongbuline Management Corporation

This subsidiary was created as a solution to the complex management and operation structure of the
shared ROW between the Dongbu Line, East-West Rail, and SR Beta.<br>
Its ownership is split 1:1:1 between Shin-Lacon, Sancheon Rapid, and MRTC. Lacon effectively holds
the majority share as both Shin-Lacon and Sancheon Rapid are owned by Lacon, adding up to 66.67%
of the shares.<br><br>
This company operates and manages the tracks and the stations from Stronghold to Banho, even including
the local-only stations on the EWR.
