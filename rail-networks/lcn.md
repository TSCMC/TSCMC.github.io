# Lacon Railway

Lacon Railway is an extensive network of overworld railways that spans most regions of the server.
The network is comprised of Lacon Railway itself and two subsidiaries, Shin-Lacon and Sancheon Rapid.

## Subsidiaries

### Shin-Lacon

This was originally planned as a supplemental network to Lacon's existing network, mainly to connect
the northern parts of Floating Moonlight city and the trading hall. However, it was soon decided to
cede over the Shin-Higashi Line to Shin-Lacon, giving it a much more extensive network.
<br>Until it ceased operations, the Shin-Higashi Line, then known as the Dongbu Line
is the longest line on the network.<br><br>
On January 20, 2025, the Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line was ceded back to Lacon, and merged with Lacon Industry Line
to form [Lacon Main Line](lcn-main-line), with the old Main Line being renamed to Kurageshima Line.
With this, the scope of Shin-Lacon was scaled down drastically, as most of the operations of the company
was ceded over to the parent company, including the Banho Harbour shuttle and ownership of Dongbuline.

### Dongbuline Management Corporation

This subsidiary was created as a solution to the complex management and operation structure of the
shared ROW between the Lacon Main Line, East-West Rail, and SR Beta.<br>
Its ownership is split 1:1:1 between Lacon, Sancheon Rapid, and MRTC. Lacon effectively holds
the majority share as Sancheon Rapid is ultimately owned by Lacon, adding up to 66.67%
of the shares.<br><br>
This company operates and manages the tracks and the stations from Stronghold to Banho, even including
the local-only stations on the EWR.
