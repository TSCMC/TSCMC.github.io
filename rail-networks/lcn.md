# Lacon Railway

Lacon Railway is an extensive network of overworld railways that spans most regions of the server.
The network is comprised of Lacon Railway itself and several subsidiaries, Shin-Lacon and Sancheon Rapid.
<br><br>
Lacon itself directly operates the Lacon Main Line and Lacon Kurageshima Line. These lines connect the far
west regions near Witch Farm to Shin-Akiyama, WHY Central, Floating Moonlight City, Sancheonville, Banho, and
eventually to the far east regions of Iwashi Valley.

## Direct Subsidiaries

### Sancheon Rapid

Sancheon Rapid is a subsidiary of Lacon that operates Sancheon Rapid Alpha and Beta.
The routes were proposed by Sancheonville and form a network of higher-speed lines that connect various
regions directly to Sancheonville.

### Shin-Lacon

This was originally planned as a supplemental network to Lacon's existing network, mainly to connect
the northern parts of Floating Moonlight city and the trading hall. However, it was soon decided to
cede over the Shin-Higashi Line to Shin-Lacon, giving it a much more extensive network.
<br>Until it ceased operations, the Shin-Higashi Line, then known as the Dongbu Line,
was the longest line on the network.<br><br>
On January 20, 2025, the Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line was ceded back to Lacon, and merged with Lacon Industry Line
to form [Lacon Main Line](lcn-main-line), with the old Main Line being renamed to Kurageshima Line.
With this, the scope of Shin-Lacon was scaled down drastically, as most of the operations of the company
was ceded over to the parent company, including the Banho Harbour shuttle and ownership of Dongbuline.<br><br>
Shin-Lacon now has a much more laid-back role, supplementing the Lacon network by serving areas that Lacon's
lines miss.

## Joint Ventures and Public-Private Partnerships

### Dongbuline Management Corporation

This subsidiary was created as a solution to the complex management and operation structure of the
shared ROW between the Lacon Main Line, East-West Rail, and SR Beta.<br>
Its ownership is split 1:1:1 between Lacon, Sancheon Rapid, and MRTC. Lacon effectively holds
the majority share as Sancheon Rapid is ultimately owned by Lacon, adding up to 66.67%
of the shares.<br><br>
This company operates and manages the tracks and the stations from Stronghold to Banho, even including
the local-only stations on the EWR.

### Koishi Railway

This is a semi-third-sector subsidiary of Lacon, where Lacon, Banho Municipal Government, and Koishi Valley Municipal
goverment all funded the founding and hold shares of the company.
The company took over an old rural single-track line that went from Banho to Udongein-Inaba via Sanae. The section from
Banho to Sanae was electrified and realigned, and a branch was built to Koishi from Sanae; the line to Koishi is now
considered the main line and the old line to Udongein-Inaba considered a branch.

### The Woodlands Express Railway

Although not technically a subsidiary of Lacon, it is deeply related with Lacon's railway network, with all of
its services through-running with the Lacon Main Line. The Woodlands Express was originally planned as a directly
operated branch line of Lacon to connect to the hypothesized location of a Pale Garden to the south.
However, the Pale Garden was not found at the speculated location, leading to Lacon abandoning this rail line.<br><br>
Afterwards, the operators of the Squid Farm and the owners of the Mansion near The Woodlands Station lobbied for the
plan to be revived, at which point Lacon gave a green light for the construction of the line under a Japanese-style
third sector company. The Republic of Yamamigaoka's national government, as well as West Rhoscoed's municipal government
all contributed funds to found the company.<br><br>
Although Lacon originally did not own any shares of this company, several initial investors were bought out by Lacon,
Lacon is currently the third largest shareholder of the company, after Yamamigaoka national government and West Rhoscoed
Municipal Government.
