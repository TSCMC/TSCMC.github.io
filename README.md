# TSCMC.github.io
The website for TSC Minecraft server

# How to add pages
Click "Add file" and select "Create new file"

At "Name your file..." box, put the name of the page that you want to be the URL and end it with `.md`
- If you want it to be `https://tscmc.github.io/theland` then it will be `theland.md`
- If you want it to be `https://tscmc.github.io/land/farm` then it will be `land/farm.md`

In the big text box, starts it with
```markdown
---
layout: default
title: insert the title of the page
description: insert the description of the page
---
```
and below that write like how you would do on discord
(ie. using # for title, using \[text\]\(link\) for links, \* for italic, etc)
since it's just a markdown file, so it uses similar formatting to discord (with some exception but don't worry about that)
