## About Building Machines

1. Lag machines not allowed
1. You should watch out for spawn chunks ([Read More](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Spawn_chunk))
1. Machines with large amounts of hoppers or entities that don't despawn
shouldn't be placed within spawn chunks (ex. Villager Breeder, Villager Trading Facility)
