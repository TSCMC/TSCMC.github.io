# Lacon WHY Central station

Lacon WHY Central station serves the area around Spawn. Connections are available
with other rail lines through [WHY Central](/rail-stations/why-central) station,
and with Spider Farm shuttle through WHY Central Base station.<br><br>
Contrary to popular belief that this station exists purely as an exercise in Lacon's
independence, when this station was built, Lacon expected that every other
company would make their own station with their own name instead of making one big
station named WHY Central.
