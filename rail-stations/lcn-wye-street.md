# Lacon Wye Street station

Lacon Wye Street station serves the area around Spawn. Connections are available with
other rail lines through [WHY Central](/rail-stations/why-central) station, and with Spider Farm shuttle through
WHY Central Base station.<br><br>
Despite popular belief that this station exists purely as an exercise in Lacon's independence,
when this station was built, Lacon expected that every other company would make their own station
instead of making one big conglomeration in WHY Central.
