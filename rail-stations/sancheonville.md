# Sancheonville

Sancheonville station is on the Northern edge of Sancheonville,
next to Sancheon's home.<br>
This station facilitates through-running between SR Alpha and SR Beta.

## Platform Structure

The main station houses two semi-underground sets of platforms at right angle to each other.
The upper set includes two dead-end platforms for the Sancheonville Line, one arriving and one departing.
The lower set is made up of two island platforms, the southern one is used by the SLCN Dongbu Line,
and the northern one is currently unused.<br><br>
There is a smaller, underground station to the south of the main station, connected to the main station
via an underground passageway, which houses SR Alpha and SR Beta lines and facilitates the through-running
of the two SR Lines.

### History

When the station first opened, there was only the upper platform level for the Lacon Higashi line 
(currently Lacon Sancheonville Line), although the station building looked not too different from
how it looks now. The lower platform level was added later with the addition of the
Lacon Shin-Higashi Line (currently Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line), with the SR Alpha later adding its own
island platform below the Shin-Higashi Line platforms.<br>
SR Alpha was later merged into the lower platform, where the former Dongbu Line eastbound platform
was repurposed for SR Alpha westbound, and another island was added for Dongbu Line eastbound and 
SR Alpha eastbound. This was done because the old SR Alpha platforms were cramped and to facilitate
cross-platform interchange between the two lines.<br>
Later, with the construction of the SR Beta, the new underground station was added to Sancheonville,
and SR Alpha was moved over to the new station to facilitate through-running between the two Sancheon
Rapid lines. This meant that two of the lower level platforms at the old station would now longer be
used, so the platforms were reverted to the old layout of both directions of Dongbu Line being on the
same island, with the SR Alpha westbound platform being reverted to Dongbu Line eastbound, and the
old eastbound platforms now being abaondoned.<br>
Currently, there are plans to reuse the old eastbound platforms for a short shuttle line to Dobrzanka.
