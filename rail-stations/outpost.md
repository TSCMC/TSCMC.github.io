# Outpost station

Outpost is a metro station on the [Southern Highlands](/rail-networks/shr)
[Loop Line](/rail-lines/shr-loop-line) which serves a pillager outpost.

## History

The station began opreations on 2024-08-12 as part of the project to join the
former Creeper Farm and Highlands lines into the Loop Line.<br>
In original plans, a station closer to the pillager outpost named Outpost would
have been an intermediate station on the Highlands Line, while another station
named Taralga closer to the site of the existant Outpost station would become an
interchange between the Highlands and Creeper Farm lines, with the Creeper Farm
Line continuing south to [Slime Farm](/rail-stations/slime-farm).
