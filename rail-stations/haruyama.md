# Haruyama

<big>春山</big><br>
Haruyama was originally built as an unmanned station with just platforms and some stairs.
It is currently a temporary station on the EWR built out of temporary materials with a planned
construction for a proper transfer station.<br>
The name, which means "Spring Mountain" was chosen as an antithesis to Akiyama, as "Aki" can
also mean autumn and this station is far away from both Akiyama and Shin-Akiyama.
