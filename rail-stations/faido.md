# Faido station

Faido station is a railway station in the Faido municipality, operated by Fulahm Railways.

## Station Layout
The station layout is unusual in that it has 2 single side platforms at different 
elevations - the southbound platform is located on one of the eastern ridges of the Asahina Massif at an elevation of y = 85m, 
while the northbound platform is located deep underground within the Shin-Asahina Tunnel at an elevation of y = XXm. Ironically, the 
southbound track faces north towards Sedrun before turning 225 degrees to ascend the Asahina Summit. 

The station is fully unstaffed owing to the station's remote nature - there are no publicly accessible paths that descend to ground level.

## Services

### Asahina Line
As of January 2025, there are 8 services per day in either direction, with gaps of 1-3 hours between services. 
Southbound services operate to Llanishen while northbound services operate to Camfford Central.
