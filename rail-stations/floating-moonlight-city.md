# Floating Moonlight City

There are two stations named Floating Moonlight City, about 2 blocks away from each other.<br>
The older one is called **Lacon Floating Moonlight City**, and the newer one is called
**Shin-Lacon Floating Moonlight City**.<br>
However, the older Lacon Floating Moonlight City is often just called Floating Moonlight
City without the *Lacon* attached.

## Lacon Floating Moonlight City

This station was originally a two-track station that was shoved into the attic of the Floating
Moonlight City main building. Later, the station was expanded with a higher ceiling and more 
tracks to reach the current form.
