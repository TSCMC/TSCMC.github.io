# Floating Moonlight City Station

There are two stations named Floating Moonlight City,<br>
one called **Lacon Floating Moonlight City**, and another one called
**Shin-Lacon Floating Moonlight City**.<br>
They are both located in [Floating Moonlight City](/areas/fmcity), 2 blocks away
from each other.<br>
However, the older Lacon Floating Moonlight City is often just called Floating Moonlight
City without the *Lacon* attached.

## Lacon Floating Moonlight City

This station was originally a two-track station that was shoved into the attic
of the Floating Moonlight City main building. Later, the station was expanded
with a higher ceiling and more  tracks to reach the current form.
