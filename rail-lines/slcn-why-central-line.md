# Shin-Lacon WHY Central Line

신래이컨 와이센트럴선/新レーコン・ワイ・セントラル線<br>
Shin-Lacon Seobu Line is currently a short line connecting [Yayajima Beach](/rail-stations/yayajima-beach) to
the trading hall via [Floating Moonlight City](/areas/ucl/fmcity).<br>
This line is currently only a short stub, with future plans for extension
to the northwest toward the Tax Evasion Chalet and eventually to Zwaluwnest.
