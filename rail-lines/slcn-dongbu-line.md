# Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line

신래이컨 동부선/新レーコン東部線<br>
Formerly known as Lacon Shin-Higashi Line, Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line is by far the longest
line on the [Shin-Lacon Network](/rail-networks/lcn), connecting Floating Moonlight City
to Sancheonville, the Stronghold, and the far east regions of the overworld.<br>
The line was originally opened as Lacon Shin-Higashi Line, and was ceded over to Shin-Lacon
from Lacon when the Shin-Lacon Seobu Line opened to [Yayajima Beach](/rail-stations/yayajima-beach).
<br><br>The section from Stronghold to Banho is run as the center express track in a shared ROW
with the [East-West Rail](mrtc-east-west-rail-line). The EWR's tracks used to be the Dongbu Line tracks,
and the current Dongbu Line tracks were used by SR Beta. However, when it was decided to run the
EWR to Banho, SR Beta was buried underground in the same ROW, the old SR Beta tracks were
repurposed for the Dongbu Line, and the Dongbu Line tracks are now used for the EWR.<br>
Due to the complex history, management, and operations, this section of the line is managed by
the Dongbuline Management Corp. which is a subsidiary Lacon.
