# Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line

신래이컨 동부선/新レーコン東部線<br>
Formerly known as Lacon Shin-Higashi Line, Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line is by far the longest
line on the [Shin-Lacon Network](/rail-networks/lcn), connecting Floating Moonlight City
to Sancheonville, the Stronghold, and the far east regions of the overworld.<br>
The line was originally opened as Lacon Shin-Higashi Line, and was ceded over to Shin-Lacon
from Lacon when the Shin-Lacon Seobu Line opened to [Yayajima Beach](/rail-stations/yayajima-beach).
