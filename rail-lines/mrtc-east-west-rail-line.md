# East-West Rail (EWR)

The East-West Rail (EWR) Line is a mainline rail of the
[Mainline Railway Transit Corporation](/rail-networks/mrt) (MRTC).
This heavy rail line aims to connect areas and settlements on the east of spawn
to the west, being a backbone of server-wide coverage on the game's X axis.

Despite the rail connects up to Dobrzanka with construction being carried out in
several places for eastward extension, there are still some single-tracked
section between Cavern Junction Station and Haruyama Station due to ongoing
building constructions in the area limitting the rail's double-tracking effort.
However, to avoid disruptions and collision, rail passing loops are installed at
several key locations.

## Through-running rail

The rail line through-run on rail sections that were built, owned and managed by
different entities.

### RichardRail

RichardRail (RR), a subsidiary of [RichardCorp]() owns and manages MRTC rail 
across RichardCorp Organised Controlled Territories (ROCT). The connection 
between [WHY Central Station](/rail-stations/why-central) and Otomune Station was 
completed and operational on 31st May 2024, before the rail gets extended
westward.

RichardCorp first submitted a proposal for a westward extension of the 
EWR by a deep tunnel through the highlands west of WHY Central, with the 
intention of connecting it to the newly claimed Richardistan. The tunnel, at
447m long, but 2m high was completed on 31st May 2024, the same day Otomune
Station was first completed.

The first train from [WHY Central Station](/rail-stations/why-central)
officially departed to Otomune Station on the same day. Otomune Station was
known at the time as Mochizuki Station but the station name was changed to avoid
confusion between the station and a different railway line currently under
planning, YuiTrans Mochizuki Line.

In addition to owning and managing the MRTC mainline section in the regions
aforementioned, RichardRail also owns and manages the shuttle train service,
East-West Rail North Branch from Otomune Station to Richardsbay Central Station
via the proposed RichardCorp Ayase Airport.
Unlike the mainline where MRTC operates the train with RichardRail managing the
rail, this branch is wholly operated and managed by RichardRail. This shuttle has
been abandoned after the Collapse of RichardCorp.

A westward extension was later built between Otomune and Mittagong North. With RR's
longstanding partnership with SHR, a peoplemover was built connecting to [Mittagong North]()
on the SHR, allowing free transfers. 

The line was further extended to Sakurauchi, where it finally connects to the RR Trunk,
before continuing west to Shirokane (now Katsuragi) and Port Watanabe.

Due to shoddy construction methods, RichardRail's operational license for the EWR 
was revoked, leading to the Collapse of RichardCorp. However, after the RichardCorp
Restructuring Programme, RichardRail and the newly formed RichardCorp Construction
Company (RCC) were given rights to rebuild the entire network.

Both the tunnel and western sections were rebuilt by RCC, with the shuttle demolished
and the EWR straightened. The stations are also expanded, from 7m to 25m, following
T-Train standards. Otomune Station was also selected to be the site of the new RichardCorp
headquarters, after the Collapse resulted in the abandonment of RichardsBay. The rebuilt Otomune
station and tunnels were completed on 28th July 2025, but are currently not in operation due
to testing works.

A new station slightly north, Yanagida was built to replace Sakurauchi as the RR Trunk interchange.
This station retains the pink cherrywood design of Sakurauchi, while expanding the station size,
fitting new standards. The station is expected to be completed by the end of August 2025.

### Yayajima High Speed Rail Incorporated

Yayajima High Speed Rail Incorporated (YJHSR Inc), a subsidiary wholly owned by
the Yayajima City Council (YJCC), owns and manages MRTC rail in the
[City of Yayajima](/areas/ucl/yayajima). The connection between Ministry of Trade
Station and [Yayajima North Station](/rail-stations/yayajima-north) was
completed and operational on 8th July 2024. The first train from Ministry of
Trade Station officially departed to Dobrzanka Station, the terminus of the
East-West Rail at the time, passing by
[Yayajima North Station](/rail-stations/yayajima-north) on the same day.

### Dobrzanka Authority

Dobrzanka Authority (DA) of the Dobrzanka region owns and manages MRTC rail in
said region. The connection between
[Yayajima North Station](/rail-stations/yayajima-north) and Dobrzanka Station
was completed and operational on 8th July 2024. The first train from
[Yayajima North Station](/rail-stations/yayajima-north) officially departed to
Dobrzanka Station on the same day.

### Lacon Railway

[Lacon Railway](/rail-networks/lcn) owns and manages a section of MRTC rail that
has been built as standalone tracks in a shared right-of-way (ROW) with the
existing [Lacon Main Line](/rail-lines/lcn-main-line) and Sancheon
Rapid Beta Line. The line serves as the local service in the shared section,
with both the Dongbu Line and SR Beta serving as express.
<br>Due to the complex operating and management structure of this section, it is
separately managed by **Dongbuline Management Corp.**, a subsidiary of Lacon.

## Stations

To make it easier to follow, the stations list here are listed from west to east
instead of from east to west, because most people are acustomed to imagining
something from left to right due to the prevalent writing direction being left
to right.

Connecting lines currently under construction or planned are italicized,
transfer to lines in separate station nearby are marked with the :transfer:
emoji, transfer to lines via nether portal are marked with the :nether: emoji,
and connection to other transport modes are marked with either the :anchor:
emoji if it's by sea or the :airplane: emoji if it's by air.

### Mainline Station

This train service is run by MRTC.
