# Shin-Lacon Main Line

신래이컨 본선/新レーコン本線<br>
Shin-Lacon Main Line, also known as Lacon New Line, is currently a short line
connecting Spawn to the northern area of [Floating Moonlight City](/areas/ucl/fmcity).<br>
Depite the "Main Line" name, this line is currently only a short stub, due to
most sections of it being incomplete, and it also isn't the first Shin-Lacon line
to have been built.
