# Shin-Lacon Main Line

신래이컨 본선/新レーコン本線<br>
Shin-Lacon Main Line, also known as Lacon New Line, is currently a short line
connecting Spawn to the northern area of [Floating Moonlight City](/areas/fmcity).<br>
Depite the "Main Line" name, this line is currently only a short stub, due to most sections of it
being incomplete, and it also isn't the first Shin-Lacon line to have been built.

## Stations

- [Lacon Wye Street](/rail-stations/lcn-wye-street) (Terminal)
- [Floating Moonlight City](/rail-stations/floating-moonlight-city)
