# Lacon Main Line

래이컨 본선/レーコン本線<br>
Lacon Main Line was formed in Jan 20, 2025 as a combination of the former Industry Line
(from Witch Farm to Floating Moonlight City) and Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line (from Floating Moonlight
City to Iwashi Valley).<br>
These two lines form the backbone of the [Lacon Network](/rail-networks/lcn), connecting
UCTL's most important cities like Floating Moonlight City, Yayajima, Sancheonville, and Banho to
various automated factories and farms in the southwest regions of the overworld.<br><br>
The section from Stronghold to Banho is run as the center express track in a shared ROW
with the [East-West Rail](mrtc-east-west-rail-line). The EWR's tracks used to be the Dongbu Line tracks,
and the current Dongbu Line tracks were used by SR Beta. However, when it was decided to run the
EWR to Banho, SR Beta was buried underground in the same ROW, the old SR Beta tracks were
repurposed for the Dongbu Line, and the Dongbu Line tracks are now used for the EWR.<br>
Due to the complex history, management, and operations, this section of the line is managed by
the Dongbuline Management Corp. which is a subsidiary of Lacon.

## History

### Lacon Industry Line

The **Lacon Industry Line**, which is the former designation of the section west of FMC, was initially built
as **Lacon Minami Line**, and was originally intended to connect Shin-Akiyama to FMC.
However, as the line was extended, the line started to serve more and more industrial areas,
eventually prompting the renaming to the Lacon Industry Line.

### Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line

The **Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line** was originally built as a bypass to the old Lacon Main Line and Lacon Higashi Line
(now designated as [Lacon Kurageshima Line](lcn-kurageshima-line) and [Lacon Sancheonville Line](lcn-sancheonville-line)).
It was called Lacon Shin-Higashi Line at the time. It was later ceded to a newly-created subsidiary of Lacon, Shin-Lacon,
under which it got renamed to Shin-Lacon Dongbu Line.
However, on January 20, 2025, it was ceded back to Lacon, and merged with Lacon Industry Line to form the new Lacon Main Line.
