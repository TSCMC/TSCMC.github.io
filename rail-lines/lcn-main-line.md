# Lacon Main Line

래이컨 본선/レーコン本線<br>
Lacon Main Line is the oldest line in the [Lacon Network](/rail-networks/lcn),
connecting Spawn and Floating Moonlight City to Lacon Forestry and Lacon's
industrial district at Kurageshima.<br>
The line has plans to be extended to Dorokawa Gōryū from the current terminus.

## Operation

Although the line is entirely operated and mostly owned and managed by Lacon, the section from the
"Welcome to Yayajima" sign to the west of [Yayajima South](/rail-stations/yayajima-south) and up to
and including the bridge to the north of [Yayajima North](/rail-stations/yayajima-north) is owned
by the Yayajima City Council, and currently managed by Yayajima High Speed Railway Inc.
