# Fulahm Railways Asahina Line
The Asahina Line is a regional railway line connecting Camfford to Llanishen in the south-west by traversing the Sedrun Mountain Range. 

## Services
There are approximately 16 services daily in either direction although not all of these cover the entire length of the line. Much of
the line within Camfford, and south of Lisvane is single-tracked which limits frequencies.

## History
The Asahina Line was originally built as an unelectrified, entirely single-tracked railway (besides passing loops). As a result the 
entire line is signalled using the Radio Electronic Token Block, controlled from the signal box at Camfford Bay Station. Due to the capacity restrictions 
caused, the line was planned to be double tracked between Sedrun and Llanishen by means of a new tunnel which crossed the mountain range. However, these plans have been indefinitely shelved.

Electrification of the line is also underway, although the track north out of Camfford will not be fully electrified. Some of the PFL's 4-car multiple units have been 
tested on the Asahina Line but are not expected to enter regular usage on the line due to the more restrictive loading gauge. At present, the Asahina Line canonically 
uses 2-car DMUs although these are planned to be supplemented by 2-car EMUs for the electrified portions of the line.
