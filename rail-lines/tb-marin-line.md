## History
The Marin Line is the first line of TruffleBahn, originally operating as a shuttle from Marinville to TruffleResort. As demands increased and more areas developed, the line was extended
via TruffleDock towards Adrestia, until the railway reconstruction is done and services from TruffleDock onwards are taken by Henrietta Line. 

Further South/Southwest extension are planned.
