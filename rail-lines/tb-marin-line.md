## History
The Marin Line is the first line of TruffleBahn, originally operating as a shuttle from Marinville to TruffleResort. As demands increased and more areas developed, the line was extended via TruffleDock towards Adrestia. Soon after, a railway reconstruction was done to improve traffic, and services from TruffleDock onwards are taken by Henrietta Line. 

Further South/Southwest extension are planned.
