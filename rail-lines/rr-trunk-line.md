# RichardRail Trunk Line

RichardRail Trunk Line</br>
Japanese: 理幹線(Rikansen)</br>
RichardRail Trunk Line is the main line by RichardRail, a subsidiary of RichardCorp. It was first
proposed as a SHR line branching off the SHR Western Line.

A Northeastern extension was also built, but due to the First Bankruptcy of Richardcorp, was sold off
to Volans Railway.

After the RichardCorp Restructuring Exercise, the line was rebuilt from SHR standards to new standards
based on T-Train, with platform lengths expanding from 7 to 25 metres. The line is currently being
rebuilt.
