# United Cities of Touyou-Leightonsy

The **United Cities of Touyou-Leightonsy**, also referred to as the **United Cities**,
**Tōyō-Leightonsy**, or **UCTL** is a federal republic formed as a union of several
settlements and cities.<br>
As a federal republic, the cities within its borders act almost like states in other
federal republics, having vast autonomy and independence from the federal government.<br>
The territories of the United Cities are often directly administered by another city, rather
than being administered by the federal government. This is because many of the cities in
the United Cities held territories and colonies prior to the formation of the union.

## Politics

The UCTL has a bicameral legislature where the senate consists of 2-3 representatives from each city,
and the house of representatives consists of representatives from each city proportional to each
city's population.<br>
The government is formed of a parliamentary system, where the house of representatives forms the basis
of the government, and the senate approves any bills or major policy changes proposed by the house of
representatives.

## Metropolitan Municipalities

Metropolitan municipalities constitute the highest class of municipality in the union.
Cities have to be approved by all of the existing metropolitan municipalities to be promoted
to a metropolitan municipality.<br>
Metropolitan Municipalities send 3 members to the senate.

### [Floating Moonlight City](fmcity)

This is the capital city of the republic. Refer to the document for more detail.

### [Yayajima](yayajima)

Yayajima is the most developed and second-most important city in the UCTL, with many of the most important railways of the
UCTL going through Yayajima. Refer to the document for more detail.

### [Banho](banho)

This is a port city in the east of the republic situated on the Bay of Banho,
it mainly facilitates trade to New Shanghai, but there are plans for canals
and shipping tunnels to facilitate trade to other areas.<br>
The city's development was led by the current mayor, Banike.
<br>Refer to the document for more detail.

## Urban Municipalities

These form the basic building block of the union, being equivalent to states or provinces
in other federations. For a new municipality to be approved, it needs an approval of a majority
in senate.<br>
Urban Municipalities send 2 members to the senate.

### Sancheonville

This is the second oldest city of the republic.<br>
The city was originally a village inhabited by indigenous villagers, until
Sancheon arrived and converted it into an industrial city with the server's biggest
cobblestone farm; he is now the mayor of this city.<br>
The city currently has authority over not just Sancheonville proper, but also the 
stronghold area and the entire island that the city is situated on.<br>
The city is served by five rail lines and a small funicular that connects the lower
section to the main downtown.

### Dobrzanka

Dobrzanka is a planned community on an island to the north of Sancheonville.
The city was planned and constructed by its current mayor, Jakub.<br>
The city has a single railway station underground beneath the Dobrzanka Tower,
served by the [MRTC East-West Rail](/rail-lines/mrtc-east-west-rail-line).
<br><br>
Dobrzanka also includes Haruyama within its city bounds. It is an undeveloped hilly plains area to the north of Dobrzanka. It is home to Haruyama station,
where the [MRTC East-West Rail](/rail-lines/mrtc-east-west-rail-line) and the
[Lacon Sancheonville Line](/rail-lines/lcn-sancheonville-line) intersect.

### Koishi Valley Consolidated Urban District

The Koishi Valley CUD was formed as a union of 5 small towns in the Southern Territories.
The 5 towns are, in no particular order, Utsuho, Sanae, Moriya, Doremi, and Udongein-Inaba.<br>
The District provided funding for 

## Territories

Territories are not-yet incorporated areas of the union, usually administered by a nearby municipality.<br>
Territories do not send any representation to the senate nor the house of representatives; instead, the residents
of the territory vote as residents of the municipality that controls the territory -- the municipality is entitled
to one additional member in the house of representatives for every territory it controls.
<br><br>
If a territory is federal -- that is, it is controlled directly by the federal government instead of being
controlled by a municipality -- then the territory is entitled to send an *observer* to the house of
representatives, who is able to attend all parliament sessions and make speeches, but not cast any votes
or take part in forming the cabinet.

### [M] [Kurageshima and Nozomigaoka](kurageshima-and-nozomigaoka)

This is a territory controlled by FMC. Refer to the document for more detail.

### [B] South Banho Territory

The South Banho Territory is a territory sandwiched between Banho and the Koishi Valley CUD.

have any stations within the territory.

### [B] Far East Territory

The Far East Territory -- controlled by banho -- is a vague territorial claim to the east of Banho.
It theoretically includes many localities such as Hartmann's Youkai Forest and the Iwashi Valley.<br>
The Far East Territory is served by the Dongbu Line, and development mostly happens around
the railway.<br>
Very little effort has been put in to ascertain the bounds of the territory, except for the western bound with
Banho and one treaty between Banho and the Tianfu Alliance regarding a border along a small ismuth.

### [Y][M] Gaung Lahar Territory

The Gaung Lahar Territory is located to the west of Yayajima, and it is administered by Yayajima.
In January 26, 2025, Yayajima ceded the control over the south and southwestern parts of the territory
to Floating Moonlight City. De jure, the entire territory is still controlled by Yayajima, with FMC sort-of
*leasing* out the southern parts for its own use.<br>
The territory doesn't have any railway stations, but the [East-West Rail](/rail-lines/mrtc-east-west-rail-line)
goes through and has a future planned station within the territory. This station will be a transfer with the
[Shin-Lacon Main Line](/rail-lines/slcn-main-line) when that line gets extended to the north from its current terminus.

### [Y] Dorokawa Gōryū

Dorokawa Gōryū is an exclave of the republic located to the north of Tianfu Alliance, controlled by Yayajima.<br>

There are several rail lines that are planned to connect the federation's mainland to this territory.

### [F] Lacon Airport Authority (East Sancheonville Territory)

This federal territory is controlled directly by a subsidiary of Lacon; the Lacon Airport Authority
functions like a local government entity of the republic, and it has near-total control over the entire
undeveloped area between Banho and Sancheonville, including Maguro Lake, Jajak Forest, and !.<br>
There are several stations within the area controlled by the LAA, the most important of which,
[Gonghang-ap](/rail-stations/gonghang-ap), is served by the [SLCN Dongbu Line](/rail-lines/slcn-dongbu-line),
SR Beta, and [MRTC East-West Rail](/rail-lines/mrtc-east-west-rail-line).

### [F] Southern Territories

This federal territory controls vast swaths of territory to the south of Banho and the Far East Territory.
This territory encompasses vast swaths of undeveloped land, sometimes reserved for future development, others
reserved for the construction of infrastructures such as canals, railways, and dams.

## Other

### Republic of Yamamigaoka

Yamamigaoka is technically an independent republic, however, it is practically a puppet state
of the UCTL, where the UCTL almost administers it as if it was its own territory, laying roads,
collecting taxes, and managing lighting/spawnproofing infrastructure.
Further, Yamamigaoka almost always copies any UCTL legislation into its own legislation (referred to as
"sychronization laws"), allowing companies and people of the UCTL to do business and travle to
Yamamigaoka without worrying about different legal systems.
