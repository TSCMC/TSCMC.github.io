# Floating Moonlight City

富裕月光街/부유월광가<br>
Floating Moonlight City is located in Hello Marina Bay, and it is served
exclusively by Lacon's rail lines. The city is heavily influenced by Lacon,
so much so that some people say that the city hall is just a Lacon subsidiary in
disguise.<br>
The city operates as an independent city-state, with its own legal system
separate from other entities nearby. <br>
The city is sometimes abbreviated as "FM City" or "F.M. City."<br>
The name comes from Inabakumori's song of the same name, linked below.

## Structure

The city is made up entirely out of buildings and walkways built atop the ocean
in the Hello Marina Bay with no natural, physical ground at all.
The "Main Building" is at the southern end of the city, with the cattle farm
attached directly to its east wing and the vertical farm attached to its north.<br>
Most of city's sustenance comes from indoor farms, beehives, and cattle farms that
use soil imported from other places, as well as imported foods from WHY Central.

## History

The city was first founded on March 8, 2024, and the first building to be built was the floating docks.<br>
Then, the storage and supersmelter complex (dubbed the "Main Building") was built, with the first Floating
Moonlight City station later being built in the attic of this building.<br>
The city was later expanded in July 17th with the walkways to the north of the Main Building,
leading way to the construction of all the other buildings that are now part of the City.<br>
In July 22nd, the Floating Moonlight City North Expansion Plan was announced, which greatly
expanded the scope of the city, and included plans for many more buildings than ever existed
until then.

## Notable buildings in Floating Moonlight City

### Main Building

This building has a cherry blossom wood construction with piers going down to the sea floor.
It has the shape of the letter "C" or the Korean consonant "ㄷ," with the 'opening' pointing
to the south.<br>
Being the first building constructed in Floating Moonlight City, this building currently serves
as storage in the east wing and houses the super smelter in the west wing. The main wing is part
of Lacon Floating Moonlight City station.

### Lacon Tower

This building has a concrete construction with the building itself reaching all the way down
to the sea floor.<br>
The Lacon Tower is the corporate headquarter for all of Lacon's subsidiaries that operate in
the overworld. The building incorporates a scheme dubbed "perpetual construction," wherein the
building is never truly *complete*, instead being constantly expanded upward as the company's
need expands.<br>
The building's interior employes a modular design, where sections of it can be divided up with
wooden walls and doors and modified at an instant's notice to respond to changes in space needs
of the different departments of the company.<br>
There are also rumors, although unconfirmed, of an underground cellar in the basement of the
building, below the docking level on the underwater portions of this building.
