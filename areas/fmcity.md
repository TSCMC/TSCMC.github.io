# Floating Moonlight City

Ý£ë®êÅÎÃÊ¶/ºÎÀ¯¿ù±¤°¡<br>
Floating Moonlight City is located in Hello Marina Bay, and it is served
exclusively by Lacon's rail lines. The city is heavily influenced by Lacon,
so much so that some people say that the city hall is just a Lacon subsidiary in
disguise.<br>
The city operates as an independent city-state, with its own legal system
separate from other entities nearby. <br>
The city is sometimes abbreviated as "FM City" or "F.M. City."
