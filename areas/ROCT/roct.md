**RichardCorp Occupied Controlled Territories (ROCT)** is land controlled by RichardCorp.
ROCT was formed by RichardCorp to enhance development northwest of the [Southern Highlands](/areas/southern-highlands.md).
The de-facto head of state is Richard Head VIII, the hereditary CEO of RichardCorp. However,
the so-called country is mainly led by a Protector and a Council of Mayors. The official
languages are English using British spelling, Japanese and Malay (unlike Yayajima, only in 
the Latin script).

## History
Despite taking up unclaimed land north of Southern Highlands. ROCT was technically split out
of the Southern Highlands. While the de-jure reason was to enhance development and building a
free society, it was rumoured to actually be due to tax evasion. Southern Highlands and ROCT,
despite the split, have an amicable relationship, with the ROCT-Southern Highlands Economic 
Partnership Treaty (RiSEPT) ensuring free trade and open borders between the two nations.

Despite the current "Western Strategy", the original plan was a Northerly expansion, however
it was failed due to excessive costs and the First Bankruptcy, causing land to be sold to
Volans.

## Territories
### Otomune (乙宗)
Otomune is the current capital of ROCT and the headquarters of RichardCorp. RichardCorp Tower
is the tallest building west of WHY Central and also holds on its roof, the RichTel Antenna, 
one of the highest range telecom/cellular tower in the server. Otomune is regarded as the white-
collar part of ROCT, with offices and companies.

### Yanagida (柳田)
Yanagida is home to Yanagida Complex, the largest and densest public housing complex in the
server. While it is mainly residential, it also holds the decentralised headquarters of 
Lilienfeld Industries and Ceras Labs, RichardCorp's industrial and technology subsidiaries.
It is also home to Sakurauchi Hill, a small hill of cherry blossoms used as a landmark in
navigation for centuries.

### Fujishima (藤島)
Fujishima is home to New Chongqing, a mountainside village which first developed long before 
the Acquisition. It is also home to Mount Fujishima, an extinct volcano with a deep crater. 
East Fujishima is also formerly known as Ayase and would have been the site of RichardCorp's
Ayase Airport. The airport was never built due to lack of funding and narrow approach avoiding
both Sakurauchi Hill and Mount Fujishima, and also proximity to Hoge Zwaluw Airport. 

### Yuugiri (夕霧)
Formerly known as RichardsBay Central and Richardopolis, this was planned as the capital of ROCT
and headquarters of RichardCorp, due to its proximity to the sea, as well as RichardsBay (actually
a riverbend). This was cancelled after the bankrupcy of RichardCorp. Yuugiri is now home to RC Farms,
one of the largest farms in the server, and development would be kept to a minimum. Yuugiri literally
means "evening mist", referring to the fog that covers the forest at sunset, which would disappear if
the forests are chopped down for development.

### Katsuragi (桂城)
Formerly known as Shirokane and Port Watanabe, this harbour town is the new maritime hub of
RichardCorp. It is an abandoned village at Aratani Savanna being extensively redeveloped, and is the
headquarters of Izumi Corporation, which is actually another RichardCorp super-subsidary for maritime
shipping, ocean liners, cargo and shipbuilding.

### Western Strategy
While the proposed borders are not confirmed, a western expansion is being planned for ROCT.
This includes an all new airport, and a further extension of the East-West Rail (EWR), and the
acquisition of many villages en-route.

### New RichardCorp Airport (RHX)
A new airport at the Western Strategy, known simply as **RHX** or **RHX Airport**, the official IATA
code originally used for Ayase Airport, this is expected to be built at the Southwestern Sea and will
consist of a single runway but with room for expansion. This is also expected to be the headquarters 
and main hub of RichardAir and Izumi Air Cargo, replacing temporary offices at New Beijing Airport.
Due to the huge size, RHX is considered its own territory, with its own mayor, and is the only one where
claims are mostly on water.

### New Taichung, Nether
The only extra-realm territory claimed by ROCT. Located in the Nether, New Taichung is envisioned as a
tax-free area for dead businessmen in hell.
