# City of WHY

**City of WHY**, sometimes referred to as **WHY City** or **Spawn City** is
an independent, neutral city-state that administers spawn and the surrounding
spawn chunks.<br>
The city is home to the central mine, the iron farm, villager reeducation camp,
and *the Commune*. People from other cities are free to take and contribute from
the Commune as they wish, with the exception of several tools and such which are
meant to be borrowed from the Commune instead of being outright taken.
