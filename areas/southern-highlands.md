The **Southern Highlands** is a region to the southeast of spawn governed by the
the Southern Highlands Regional Council. The region is home to a large
poppulation of villagers which are given free roam - the largest
financial, [transportation](/rail-stations/moss-vale), and population centre is
found in Moss Vale.

The name "Southern Highlands" may be considered to be a misnomer, as while the
region contains a highlands biome, the vast majority of its development is
closer to sea level in elevation. English is the de facto main language of the
Southern Highlands, while Japanese, Chinese, and Toki Pona are very occaisonally
used.
