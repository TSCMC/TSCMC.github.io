The Southern Highlands is a region to the southeast of spawn governed by the
the Southern Highlands Regional Council (SHRC). The region is home to a large
poppulation of villagers which are given free roam - the largest transportation,
financial, and population centre is found in Moss Vale and its suburbs.<br>
The SHRC owns and operates the [Southern Highlands Railway](/rail-networks/shr),
with [Moss Vale station](/rail-stations/moss-vale) being its main hub.<br>
The region has no defined boundaries.

## Langauges

English is the de facto main language of the Southern Highlands, while Japanese,
Chinese, and Toki Pona are very occaisonally used.<br>
The name "Southern Highlands" may be considered to be a misnomer, as while the
region contains a highlands biome, the vast majority of its development is
closer to sea level in elevation.
