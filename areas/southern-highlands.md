The **Southern Highlands** (sometimes abbreviated as **SoHi**) is a region to the
southwest of [spawn](/areas/cityofwhy) governed by the the
Southern Highlands Regional Council (SHRC). It is bordered by [Richmond](/areas/Richmond/richmond)
to the northwest, Truffle Resort to the south, and Shin-Akiyama and [New Beijing](/areas/cums/new-beijing)
to the southeast. The region is home to a large poppulation of villagers which
are given free roam - the largest transportation, financial, and population centre
is found in Moss Vale and its suburbs.<br>
The SHRC owns and operates the [Southern Highlands Railway](/rail-networks/shr),
with [Moss Vale station](/rail-stations/moss-vale) being its main hub.<br>

## History

Moss Vale is one of the oldest artificial settlements in the world, founded in
March 2024, when settlers from Bundanoon, which most of the modern population of
Moss Vale Metropolis descend from, landed at what is now Moss Vale Docks. The SHRC
was declared shortly after, with Bowral and Mittagong joining Moss Vale in a union.
The RichardCorp Occupied Controlled Territories, now commonly known as Richmond,
were founded as an offshoot of the Southern Highlands early in its history. The
prefecture system was conceived on November 2024 with the establishment of eight
prefectures with boundaries mainly based on ethnicity: Moss Vale, Bowral, Mittagong,
Bundanoon, Tahmoor, Thirlmere, Merran Bay, and Little Cybertron. In August 2025,
Mittagong, Tahmoor, and Thirlmere prefectures were amalgamated into the United West
Prefecture, and Merran Bay was merged into Bundanoon. Little Cybertron, owing to
its abandonment, was reorganised from a prefecture into direct administration by
the SHRC.

## Langauges

Commonwealth English is the sole working language of the Southern Highlands.
Toki Pona is a traditional language of ethnic Bundanooner residents, and Cantonese
is spoken by some minority groups, largely in the west of the region, where
Traditional Chinese is used. Japanese is used due to cultural ties.<br>
The name "Southern Highlands" may be considered to be a misnomer, as while the
region contains a highlands biome, the vast majority of its area is
closer to sea level in elevation.

## Areas

The SHRC consists of four prefectures (Moss Vale Metropolis, Bowral, Bundanoon,
and the United West Prefecture) and one uninhabited administrative zone
(the Little Cybertron Administration). Each prefecture governs a number of suburbs,
divisions of land used for adressing and elections. Each suburb is granted one seat
in the House of Representatives of the Council.
