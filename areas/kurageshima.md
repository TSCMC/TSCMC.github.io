# Kurageshima and Nozomigaoka

Kurageshima and Nozomigaoka is an area to the northeast of [Yayajima](yayajima),
built and administered by the [Floating Moonlight City](fmcity) as its colony.
Although the two were developed together, they serve very different purposes.

## Kurageshima

クラゲ島/쿠라게시마<br>
Kurageshima is an island located in the east part of the region,
it was extensively terraformed to be completely flat at just 1 block above sea
level. The island was developed to serve as the home of Lacon's factories and
farms, but only the bamboo farm has been built here so far.<br>
The island is also home to a small turtle sanctuary.<br>
The name translates to "Jellyfish Island" and is a reference to a song (linked below).

## Nozomigaoka

のぞみヶ丘/노조미가오카<br>
Nozomigaoka, which literally translates to "Hill of Hope,"
is a hill on the "mainland" to the west of Kurageshima.
There is a small village of the same name at the base of the hill,
administered by the Floating Moonlight City as a colony.
Being an artificial village constructed by Floating Moonlight City
as a part of the Kurageshima and Nozomigaoka development plan,
the villagers living in Nozomigaoka come from the Ministry of Love.<br>
The southern slopes and the peak of the hill is used as tree-planting
grounds for Lacon Forestry, which supplies much of the timber used in
the construction of Floating Moonlight City.<br>
