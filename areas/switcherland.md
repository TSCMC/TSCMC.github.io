# Neutral Territory of Switcherland

**The Neutral Territory of Switcherland**, sometimes referred to as **Switcherland** or **Spawn** is
a neutral, independent territory established by the United Cities to prevent anyone else from claiming
the area as theirs.
Although it was created by the United Cities, the UCL exerts absolutely no control over the territory.
<br>The Empress, WHY (aka Yui), only holds a ceremonial role, and the territory is "For everyone, by everone,
of everyone."

## [WHY City](city-of-why)

This is the capital city of the territory. It has authority over most of the spawn chunks and
houses the Commune. Refer to the document for more information.

## Ministry of Love and Trade

The two ministries are located right next to each other and also belong to Switcherland.
<br>The Minister of Trade, Felix, manages both ministries and is responsible for establishing
the communal trading hall.
