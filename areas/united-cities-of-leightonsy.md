# United Cities of Touyou-Leightonsy

The United Cities of Touyou-Leightonsy is a federal republic formed as a union of several
settlements and cities.<br>
As a federal republic, the cities within its borders act almost like states in other
federal republics, having vast autonomy and independence from the federal government.<br>
The territories of the United Cities are often directly administered by another city, rather
than being administered by the federal government. This is because many of the cities in
the United Cities held territories and colonies prior to the formation of the union.
