# United Cities of Leightonsy

The United Cities of Leightonsy is a federal republic formed as a union of several
settlements and cities.<br>
As a federal republic, the cities within its borders act almost like states in other
federal republics, having vast autonomy and independence from the federal government.<br>
The territories of the United Cities are often directly administered by another city, rather
than being administered by the federal government. This is because many of the cities in
the United Cities held territories and colonies prior to the formation of the union.

## Territories and Constituencies

### [Floating Moonlight City](fmcity)

This is the capital city of the republic. Refer to the document for more detail.

### [Kurageshima and Nozomigaoka](kurageshima-and-nozomigaoka)

This is a territory of the republic. Refer to the document for more detail.

### Sancheonville

This is the second most important city of the republic.<br>
The city was originally a village inhabited by indigenous villagers, until
Sancheon arrived and converted it into an industrial city with the server's biggest
cobblestone farm; he is now the mayor of this city.<br>
The city currently has authority over not just Sancheonville proper, but also the 
stronghold area and the entire island that the city is situated on.<br>
The city is served by five rail lines and a small funicular that connects the lower
section to the main downtown.

### Banho

This is a port city in the east of the republic situated on the Bay of Banho,
it mainly facilitates trade to New Shanghai, but there are plans for canals
and shipping tunnels to facilitate trade to other areas.<br>
The city's development was led by the current mayor, Banike.

### Lacon Airport Authority

This subsidiary of Lacon functions like a local government entity of the republic,
and it has vast authority over the entire undeveloped area between Banho and Sancheonville,
including Maguro Lake, Jajak Forest, and !.

### Far East Territories

The Far East Territories is a vague territorial claim to the east of Banho. It theoretically
includes many localities such as Hartmann's Youkai Forest and the Iwashi Valley, but its bounds
are unclear.

### Republic of Yamamigaoka

Yamamigaoka is technically an independent republic, however, it is practically a puppet state
of the UCL, where the UCL almost administers it as if it was its own territory, laying roads,
collecting taxes, and managing lighting/spawnproofing infrastructure.

## Alliances

### [Yayajima](yayajima)

Yayajima has a special relationship with the UCL, sharing many railways and having open immigration
policies. Although there are no formal established relationships between the two, Yayajima acts as
if it were a city of the UCL, and may join the UCL in the near future.
